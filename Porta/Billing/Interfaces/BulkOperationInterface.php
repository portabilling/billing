/**
 * Interface for element of bulk/concurrent call to the billing. Represents one API call task.
 *
 * How it works:
 * - callConcurrent() crawl given iterable recursively to find all objects,
 * implementing AsyncOperationInterface
 * - For each object, it will get the API endpoint by calling `getCallEndpoint()`
 * and call params by calling `getCallParams()`
 * - All the found array will be called in parallel with respect to desired
 * concurrency level
 * - For each object:
 *     - if the call was succed, the result will put to the object by call p
 * rocessResponse()
 *     - in a case of failure exception object will put to the object by
 * calling processException()
 *
 * Finally we have each object filled with call result, good or bad.
